The files contained represent about 5% of the entire application and are in no way all-encompassing of the entire coded solution. The files provided demonstrate coding examples and collaborative implementation of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL technologies among others. Included are sample files from one of my first projects from 2010-2011. Employs HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL to save user data and activities via a login account so that users may track progress and performance.
